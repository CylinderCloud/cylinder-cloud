          Privacy Policy
        </h1>
        
        <p class="mb-30">
          1. This Privacy Policy explains how Rishabh Software Private Limited
          (“RSPL”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles information in connection with
          the Gas Cylinder Inventory Management Software (Demo Version)
          (“Software”). The Software is provided solely for testing, evaluation,
          and demonstration purposes, and does not collect, process, or transmit
          personal data from its users.
        </p>

       
        <p>
           2. Information that is Not Collected:<br/><br/>
          RSPL does not collect, store, or share any of the following
          information through this demo version of the Software:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>( a ) Personal identifiers (e.g., name, email, phone number)</li>
          <li>( b ) Location data</li>
          <li>( c ) Contact lists</li>
          <li>( d ) Usage analytics</li>
          <li>( e ) Device identifiers or IP addresses</li>
          <li>( f ) Photos, media, or files</li>
          <li>( g ) Any other personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-30">
         3.  If you voluntarily provide feedback, comments, or bug reports to RSPL
          (via email or other communication channels), such information is
          collected solely for the purpose of improving the Software. This
          feedback is not linked to your identity unless you include personal
          details voluntarily. RSPL does not sell, rent, or disclose such
          feedback to any third party.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-30">
          4. Although the Software does not collect personal information, RSPL
          employs reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard
          the integrity of any limited data (such as feedback emails) we may
          receive. However, no digital transmission or storage method is
          completely secure. You provide feedback information at your own
          discretion and risk.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-30">
          5.This demo Software does not integrate with or rely on any third-party
          analytics, advertising, or cloud-based services (such as Google
          Analytics, Firebase, or crash reporting tools). If any third-party
          service is added in a future version, this Privacy Policy will be
          updated accordingly and you will be notified within the app or on our
          website.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-30">
          6. The Software is not intended for, and should not be used by,
          individuals under the age of 18 years. RSPL does not knowingly collect
          any data from minors.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-30">
          7. As this demo version does not involve data processing, most data
          subject rights (e.g., access, correction, deletion) under GDPR and
          similar laws are not applicable, unless you voluntarily provide
          personal data. However, if you have shared personal details
          voluntarily via feedback and wish to have them deleted, please contact
          us at
          <a href="mailto:sales&#64;rishabhsoft.com"
            >sales&#64;rishabhsoft.com</a
          >, and we will delete such information promptly.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-30">
          8. RSPL reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. The
          updated version will be posted on our website with a revised
          “Effective Date.” Continued use of the Software after updates
          constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
        </p>
