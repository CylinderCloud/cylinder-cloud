        <h3>1. Introduction:</h3>
        <p class="mb-30">
          This Privacy Policy explains how Rishabh Software Private Limited
          (“RSPL”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles information in connection with
          the Gas Cylinder Inventory Management Software (Demo Version)
          (“Software”). The Software is provided solely for testing, evaluation,
          and demonstration purposes, and does not collect, process, or transmit
          personal data from its users.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Information that is Not Collected:</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>3. Feedback Provided by Users:</h3>
        <p class="mb-30">
          If you voluntarily provide feedback, comments, or bug reports to RSPL
          (via email or other communication channels), such information is
          collected solely for the purpose of improving the Software. This
          feedback is not linked to your identity unless you include personal
          details voluntarily. RSPL does not sell, rent, or disclose such
          feedback to any third party.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Data Security:</h3>
        <p class="mb-30">
          Although the Software does not collect personal information, RSPL
          employs reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard
          the integrity of any limited data (such as feedback emails) we may
          receive. However, no digital transmission or storage method is
          completely secure. You provide feedback information at your own
          discretion and risk.
        </p>

        <h3>5. No Third-Party Services:</h3>
        <p class="mb-30">
          This demo Software does not integrate with or rely on any third-party
          analytics, advertising, or cloud-based services (such as Google
          Analytics, Firebase, or crash reporting tools). If any third-party
          service is added in a future version, this Privacy Policy will be
          updated accordingly and you will be notified within the app or on our
          website.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Use by Minors:</h3>
        <p class="mb-30">

          any data from minors.
        </p>

          subject rights (e.g., access, correction, deletion) under GDPR and
          similar laws are not applicable, unless you voluntarily provide
          personal data. However, if you have shared personal details
          voluntarily via feedback and wish to have them deleted, please contact
